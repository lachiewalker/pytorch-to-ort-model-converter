# pytorch-to-ort-model-converter

This project is used to convert MobileNetV2-architecture neural network models from PyTorch's .pth format to ONNXRuntime's .ort format.

This project is designed to facilitate model conversion from either local or remote (using GitHub Codespaces) workspaces.

## Codespaces
Execution via a Github Codespace is preferable due to the repeatability of the enviroment. Additionally, for usage on systems which:
* Do not meet the local execution requirements, or
* Produce unexpected results

Codespace execution may be necessary.
### Usage
To run the conversion on codespaces, launch a `docker in docker` codespace from the project splash page. Drag and drop your model-name.pth file into the project directory.
Execute **convert_model.sh** in the codespace terminal by passing in the path to your .pth model, and the number of species identified by the model.

`./convert_model.sh [path to .pth model] [number of species identified]`

Eg: `./convert_model.sh model257species.pth 257`

After successful conversion of your model, a .ort file will appear in the Codespace explorer with the same name as the input model. 
To copy the model onto a local machine, right-click and select 'Download' from the context menu.

## Local
Once the docker image has been built, a local instance of this project may facilitate faster conversion by doing away with the need to launch a Codespace.
### Requirements
Local conversion requires:
* Docker
* A terminal capable of executing bash scripts

### Usage
To run the conversion locally, clone the repository to your local machine and copy your model-name.pth file into the project directory.
Execute **convert_model.sh** by passing in the path to your .pth model, and the number of species identified by the model.

`./convert_model.sh [path to .pth model] [number of species identified]`

Eg: `./convert_model.sh model257species.pth 257`
